# A mostly Windows Universal / WPF Portable Application
This repository is a simple example of a tiny portable Windows application.
It uses PCLs to maximize code sharing between UAP and WPF frameworks.
It uses [SQLite](http://sqlite.org/download.html) for data access and [MVVMLight](http://www.mvvmlight.net/) for MVVM implementation.
